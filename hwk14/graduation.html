The Grand Procession of Degree Candidates marks the beginning of the university-wide commencement ceremony. Degree candidates from each college and school will gather in their designated marshaling area in and around the Littlefield Fountain and will be led by faculty marshals to reserved seating on the Main Mall. In leading the procession, marshals are easily identified by the decorative and historic ceremonial mace they carry. UT’s collection of maces symbolize academic authority and position. Wood and carving for some of the maces came from Old Main, UT’s first academic structure built in the 1880s. The UT Tower now occupies the same place on campus as the Old Main Building and serves as the setting for the university-wide commencement ceremony.
